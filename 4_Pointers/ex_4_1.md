# Question
Given that a pointer holds the value of a memory address,
why is it permitted to add an integer data type value to
a pointer variable but not a double data type?

***

# Answer
In my view, since pointer holds a memory address, ***and an memory address is an integer***, adding an integer to a pointer is permitted.  
A pointer can be regard as a start of an array, like  
*****int * a***** equals to *****a[0]*****   
you can not find an a[0.24], because addresses are integer type. So adding an integer to another integer makes sense, while adding a double to an integer doesn't.
