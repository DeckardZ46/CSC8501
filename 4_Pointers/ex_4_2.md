# Question
Suppose we have a pointer to float data type which contains the memory address value 100. If we add the integer value 3 to this pointer, what will be the value of the pointer if float data types are 4 bytes in length?
***
# Answer
For example, if we have a ***float\* a***, and it holds the memory address 100, since float data types are 4 bytes in length, \*(a+3) should hold a memory address of 100+(3*4) = 112.
