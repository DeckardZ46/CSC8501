# Question  

What is “Stack Overflow” and why might a Recursive method be susceptible to this kind of problem?
***
# Answer  

Stack Overflow is when the size of local variables we use is larger than available call stack memory size, it will cause an error.  
And in a recursive method, compliler will not release local variable automatically, instead, local variables will be added into stack in every recursive method calling, so when we call recursive method too many times, the calling stack memory will constantly be taken, until stack overflow occurs.
